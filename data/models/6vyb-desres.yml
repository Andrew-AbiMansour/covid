name: "Trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (open  state) in aqueous solution"
pdbids:
  - 6vyb
proteins:
  - spike
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  Solvated structure of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in open state. The C- and N-peptide termini, including those
  exposed due to missing loops in the published structural models, are capped with amide and acetyl groups respectively. 
  The system was solvated, neutralized and salted with NaCl, with a final concentration of 0.15 M. The total number of 
  atoms in the system was 715439.
