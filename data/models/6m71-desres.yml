name: "SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 RNA polymerase complex in aqueous solution"
pdbids:
  - 6m71
proteins:
  - RdRP
  - NSP7
  - NSP8
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  The C- and N-peptide termini capped with amide and acetyl groups respectively. 
  The missing loops in the published structural models were manually built as extended peptide conformation. 
  The missing part of Chain D was built through homology modeling using the structure of SARS-CoV-1 polymerase 
  complex (PDB entry 6NUR). The system was neutralized and salted with NaCl, with a final concentration of 0.15 M.
