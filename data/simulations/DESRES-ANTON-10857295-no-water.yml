title: DESRES-ANTON-10857295 75 µs conventional MD simulation of a chimeric RBD in complex with ACE2, no water or ions
description: >
    SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cells is mediated by a protein-protein interaction between the 
    receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and the human ACE2 receptor. We performed 
    a 75 µs conventional MD simulation of a chimeric RBD in complex with ACE2 (PDB entry 6VW1). 
    In the simulation the complex was stable, and no dissociation events were observed. We provide below 
    the conventional MD simulation. The complex model was solvated in a ~140 Å box of 200 mM NaCl and water, 
    and parameterized with the DES-Amber protein and ion force field, the TIP4P-D water model, and an 
    in-house force field derived from GAFF. Simulations were performed under the NPT ensemble at 300 K. 
    During the AWE simulations, we used a 100.8 ps resampling interval to enhance the sampling of (i) 
    the distance between the RBD and ACE2 centers of mass, (ii) the total number of atomic contacts 
    between the RBD and ACE2, and (iii) the complex pRMSD (the square root of the product of the RMSD 
    of the RBD after aligning on ACE2 and the RMSD of ACE2 after aligning on the RBD).
